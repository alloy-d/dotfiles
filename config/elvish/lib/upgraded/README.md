These files shouldn't be here!  And I didn't write them!

These were run through the [script upgrader for Elvish
0.17][script-upgrader].

Presumably these tools will take a bit to catch up to the
backwards-incompatible changes introduced in 0.17, so it seems to me
like just hard-coding the translated versions here for now is the
path of least (temporary) resistance.
